I'm thinking about Lasso regression, or more generally about regularization. Basically, I wanted to see if there is a nice way to rephrase Lasso regularization as a quadratic convex problem. I think the answer is 'yes, but at what cost' (pun only intended in hindsight).


## A simple realization
I don't like the absolute value function, I usually prefer to think of it as $\vert x\vert=\sqrt{x^2}$.
